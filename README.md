# Time-Series-Classification

- Classification of human activities based on time series data obtained by a Wireless Sensor Network

# Main Tasks:

- Extracting time-domain features from the data
- Building a 90% bootstrap confidence interval for the standard deviation of each time-domain feature that was extracted
- Perform Binary Classification using Logistic Regression and plotting scatterplots 
- Use Stratified K-fold cross validation to prune the features set and handle class imbalance
- Aanlyze performance using confusion matrix, ROC and AUC for the classifier on train data
- Test the classifier on test set and compare the accuracy on the test set with the CV accuracy obtained previously
- Perform Binary Classification using L1- penalized logistic regression and compare with the previous model
- Perform Multi-Class Classification using L1-penalized logistic multinomial regression 
- Perform Multi-Class Classification using both Gaussian Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier and compare the results with     the previous model
